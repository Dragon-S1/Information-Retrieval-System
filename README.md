# Information-Retrieval-System
Built a search engine from scratch and a comparative analysis of search engine models. The Cranfield dataset will be used for this purpose.

- Assignment-1 : Built a basic text processing module that implements sentence segmentation, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization and stopword removal.
- Assignment-2 : Implementing an Information Retrieval system using the Vector Space Model.
- Project : Comparative analysis of search engine models, specifically the Vector Space Model (VSM), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and transformer-based models (BERT), on the Cranfield dataset.
